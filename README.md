This repo contains all the code currently used for CDA ETL flows from CRDC DCs into the central CDA metadatabase.

This is beta code: all of it is under active development, but we have reached a point where it can stably generate CDA data releases.

Planned code-level updates include but are really hilariously not limited to:

* Collect GDC transformation-phase code into a Python object
* collect all PDC ETL flow code into Python objects
* port entire system to cloud operations using AirFlow
* synchronize flow deployment with CDA's migration to an RDBMS instance from BigQuery
