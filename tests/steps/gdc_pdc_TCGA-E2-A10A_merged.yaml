# This is an example of the last stage of transformation where
# the GDC harmonized data is merged with the PDC harmonized data
#
# If you put on your data model hat, the way to interpret this is that the
# (anonymous) top level is a Patient. Fields that begin with capital letters
# like ResearchSubject are not actually part of the entity, but are a way of
# linking that entity to another.
