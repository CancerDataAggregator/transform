# This represents one important stage of the data processing. This is where we
# have the final structure of the data, but we haven't done two things: 
# 1. Multiple ResearchSubjects belonging to the same Patient have not been aggregated and 
# 2. ResearchSubjects belonging to the same Patient from different DCs have not been aggregated. 
# 
# If you put on your data model hat, the way to interpret this is that the
# (anonymous) top level is a Patient. Fields that begin with capital letters
# like ResearchSubject are not actually part of the entity, but are a way of
# linking that entity to another.

# The top level corresponds to the Patient entity
